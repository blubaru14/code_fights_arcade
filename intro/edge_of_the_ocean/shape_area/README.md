Below we will define an `n`-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given `n`.

A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. An `n`-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the `n - 1`-interesting polygon and appending `1`-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the `1`-, `2`-, `3`- and `4`-interesting polygons in the picture below.

__Example__

* For `n = 2`, the output should be <br /> `shapeArea(n) = 5`;
* For `n = 3`, the output should be <br /> `shapeArea(n) = 13`.

__Input/Output__

* __[time limit] 4 seconds (go)__
* __[input] integer n__ <br /> _Guaranteed constraints:_ <br />`1 ≤ n < 104`.

* __[output] integer__ <br />The area of the `n`-interesting polygon.
